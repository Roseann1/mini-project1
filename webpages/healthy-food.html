        <h1 >11 Best Muscle-Building Foods: What to Eat to Gain Muscle</h1>
        <h4>The foods you eat and the type of exercise you include can help you prevent muscle loss.</h4>
        <img src="images/meat.jpg" style="width: 70%; height:400px;"><br>
        <h5>Maintaining muscle is key to maintaining a healthy, active lifestyle at any age. <br><br> After age 50, muscle mass, specifically muscle in your legs, decreases by 1% to 2% each year, and strength decreases by 1.5% to 5% per year, per the 2019 revised European consensus of sarcopenia published in Age and Ageing. This age-related muscle loss, called sarcopenia, can be reduced or prevented with two fundamental lifestyle changes: consuming the proper foods and including resistance training. </h5>
        <h5>Here we share foods to include to improve muscle mass, and we look at the impact that resistance training has on our muscular and bone health.</h5>
        <br><br>
        <h1>11 Best Muscle-Building Foods</h1><br>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/avocado.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>1. Avocados</h2><br>
        <p>Avocados are an excellent plant-based source of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated "healthy" fats.  </p>
        <p>In addition to helping lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and raise good cholesterol (HDL), avocados have the highest source of protein of any fruit. They are an excellent source of magnesium and potassium, minerals which support muscle recovery. Further, they provide a good source of folic acid, which, according to a 2019 review published in Archives of Pharmacal Research, may have a positive impact on muscle development.  </p>
        </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/beans.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>2. Beans</h2><br>
        <p>Beans are high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and plant-based protein and low in fat. </p>
        <p>They are an excellent and economical source of leucine, one of the three amino acids used by muscles to give energy during exercise and thought to improve muscle growth.  </p>
    </div>
    <div id="container">
        <img src="images/eggs.jpg " id="image">
        <h2>3. Eggs</h2><br>
        <p>If you are looking for the perfect post-workout meal, you may want to include an egg.</p>
        <p>Researchers found that after a resistance workout, those who consumed a whole egg, not just an egg white, experienced increased protein synthesis that may stimulate muscle growth, per a 2021 study published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.   </p>
    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/fish.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>4. Fatty Fish</h2><br>
        <p>Tuna, salmon, snapper and yellowtail are all excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fat that has been found to help reduce muscle loss and function and could actually increase muscle mass, per a 2020 article published in Frontiers in Nutrition. </p>
        <p>Not a fan of fish? Try a fish oil supplement instead. </p>
    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/yogurt.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>5. Greek Yogurt</h2><br>
        <p>Full of protein and gut-healthy probiotics, nonfat plain Greek yogurt is an excellent choice for those looking to maintain or build muscle and reduce body fat. </p>
        <p>A 2019 study published in Frontiers in Nutrition found that participants who included nonfat plain Greek yogurt as part of a post-exercise meal saw greater strength, muscle thickness and body composition than those who received a no-protein snack. </p>
        <p>Be sure to skip the blended, flavored yogurts, though, as they often have high amounts of added sugar that would negate the potential health benefits. </p>
    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/oatmeal.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>6. Oatmeal</h2>
        <p>Whole grains are an excellent source of complex carbohydrates that your body needs for energy. Oatmeal provides a healthy mix of carbohydrates, plant-based protein, fiber and nutrients that will help to keep you full longer between meals.  </p>
        <p>As with Greek yogurt, remember to skip the flavored oatmeal, as it is often high in added sugar. Go for plain oats instead, and try adding dried fruit for added vitamins and a hint of natural sweetness. </p>
    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/poultry.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>7. Poultry</h2>
        <p>Skinless, white-meat chicken and turkey (think breast versus thigh) provide an excellent source of lean protein, including the essential amino acid leucine, B vitamins and minerals that are key components of building and maintaining muscle. </p>
        <p>Including poultry as a part of a vegetable-rich diet has also been found to help reduce the risk of cardiometabolic diseases, per a 2022 review published in Nutrients.</p>
    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/nuts.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>8. Nuts and Seeds</h2>
        <p>Nuts and seeds are a good source of plant-based healthy fats, protein and carbohydrates. Nuts and seeds also have fiber, vitamins and minerals that support many of the body's systems.</p>
        <p>While there are health benefits to all nuts and seeds, pumpkin seeds are one of the stars of the show when it comes to muscle health and maintenance. They are high in polyunsaturated fats, leucine, iron, magnesium, folate and vitamin K. Vitamin K has been shown to play a role in muscle maintenance and recovery and bone health, per a 2019 article published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences.</p>
    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/Quinoa.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>9. Quinoa</h2>
        <p>Quinoa is a whole grain, like oatmeal, that provides an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, plant-based protein, vitamins and minerals. However, it is one of the only whole grains that is also a complete proteinâ€”meaning that it contains all of the nine essential amino acids not produced by the body that must be consumed through food. </p>
        <p>Quinoa is full of antioxidants, fiber, iron, folate and magnesium and lysine, an essential amino acid important in synthesizing protein, per a 2019 article published in the International Journal of Food Science.  </p>
    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/tofu.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>10. Tofu</h2>
        <p>Long known as the king of plant-based protein, soy-based tofu is a staple in vegetarian and vegan kitchens because of its nutrient density, antioxidant properties, high protein content and versatility.  </p>
        <p>Research also indicates that protein from soybeans, the primary ingredient in tofu, is similar to whey protein in its impact on muscle growth and offers cardiovascular advantages that animal-based proteins may not offer. </p>
        <p>Additionally, soy may provide beneficial properties, such as gut-healthy prebiotics and probiotics and isoflavones to promote bone health.</p>
    </div>
        <div id="container">
        <img src="images/chocolatemilk.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>11. Chocolate Milk</h2>
        <p>This may come as a surprise, but chocolate milk provides a good mix of protein and carbohydrates that make it an excellent addition to a post-workout snack.</p>
        <p>Williams says, "I love chocolate milk! Just be sure to compare labels and make your choice based on brands that contain less added sugar." </p>

        <h1>The Bottom Line</h1>
        <h6>Nutrition and exercise work together and complement each other to improve muscle mass and function.  </h6>
        <h6>The research is clear: By implementing a balanced diet, including key muscle-building foods and exercise, with a specific focus on resistance training at least two days each week, you can build muscle to feel stronger, move better and enjoy a more active lifestyle at any age.</h6>
