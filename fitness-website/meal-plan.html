  <h1 >1-Week Healthy and Balanced Meal Plan Ideas</h1>

  <h2 style="padding-left: 680px;">Why Nutrition is Important for a Healthy and Balanced Diet</h2>
  <div class="nutrition">
    <p>Planning a daily menu isn't difficult as long as each meal and snack has some protein, fiber, complex carbohydrates, and a little bit of fat.</p>
    <p>Meal planning can help keep you on track, no matter what your nutrition goal is. Prepping and planning doesn’t have to be time-intensive and complicated. A few simple steps, including basic meal constructs, making a shopping list, shopping strategically, and methodically preparing food ahead of time, are what make meal planning a helpful tool to keep you energized, meet your nutrition goals, reduce food waste, and save money.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>7-Day Sample Menu</h2>
  <div class="menu">
  <p>This one-week meal plan was designed for a person who needs about 2,000 to 2,200 calories per day and has no dietary restrictions. Your daily calorie goal may vary. Learn what it is below, then make tweaks to the plan to fit your specific needs. Consider working with a registered dietitian or speaking with a health care provider to assess and plan for your dietary needs more accurately.</p>
  <p>Each day includes three meals and three snacks and has a healthy balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. You'll also get plenty of fiber from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes.</p>
  <p>It's OK to swap out similar menu items, but keep cooking methods in mind. Replacing a sirloin steak with grilled chicken is fine, for instance, but replacing it with chicken-fried steak isn't going to work because of the breading changes the fat, carb and sodium counts—and the calories. Finally, you can adjust your calorie intake by eliminating snacks if you want to lose weight or eating larger snacks if you want to gain weight.</p>

      <p>Planning healthy meals isn't difficult, but if you're not used to it, the planning can take a little practice. The examples we provided should give you a great start. Don't feel discouraged if you don't stick to the plan exactly as outlined—it's OK to make variations that fit your lifestyle and needs. Do your best to incorporate healthy choices into your day—vegetables, fruit, lean proteins, beans and legumes, and whole grains are always smart bets.</p>
      <p>We recognize that meal plans may not be appropriate for all, especially those with disordered eating habits. If you or a loved one are coping with an eating disorder, contact the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) Helpline for support at 1-800-931-2237.</p>
